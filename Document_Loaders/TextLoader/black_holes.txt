Black Holes

A black hole is a region in space where gravity is so strong that
nothing, not even light, can escape from it. They are formed when very
massive stars run out of fuel and collapse under their own gravity at
the end of their life cycle. The core collapses into an extremely dense
point called a singularity, surrounded by an event horizon, which marks
the boundary beyond which nothing can return.

Black holes are generally classified into three main types. Stellar-mass
black holes form from collapsing stars and are a few times more massive
than the Sun. Supermassive black holes, found at the centers of most
galaxies, including our Milky Way, can be millions or even billions of
times more massive than the Sun. There is also evidence for
intermediate-mass black holes, which fall between these two categories,
though they are harder to detect.

Despite their name, black holes are not empty space. They have mass, can
grow by pulling in nearby matter, and can even merge with other black
holes. When matter falls into a black hole, it heats up and emits
intense radiation, allowing astronomers to detect black holes
indirectly. The study of black holes has helped scientists test theories
of gravity, especially Einstein’s theory of general relativity.

Black holes remain one of the most fascinating and mysterious objects in
the universe, pushing the limits of our understanding of space, time,
and physics itself.
