June 3, 2025 - Elephanta is an island located about an hour away from Mumbai. If it wasn’t so hazy you could see it from the shore, but with the air quality today that is usually unlikely. The main attractions on the island are the remarkable caves, accessed via 100 steps, which were turned into a series of Hindu temples. September 26, 2025 - Usually it also doubles as a day picnic but we recommend doing at least 2-3 days so that you get to explore places like the Lohagarh Fort, chill by the Kune Falls take photos by the Pawna Lake and enjoy cheese corn bhajiya and maggi at Tiger Point .\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mThought: Based on the current weather in Mumbai, which is hazy, and the search results, I can suggest some good places to visit. Since it's hazy, it's better to visit indoor locations or places with minimal outdoor exposure. However, some outdoor locations like the Elephanta Caves, which is an island located about an hour away from Mumbai, can still be visited. The caves are a series of Hindu temples and can be a good place to visit despite the haze. Other places like the Prince of Wales Museum can also be considered.\n",
