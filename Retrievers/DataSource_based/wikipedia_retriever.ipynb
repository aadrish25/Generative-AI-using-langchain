A popular local etymology of Kashmir is that it is land desiccated from water.\\nAn alternative etymology derives the name from the name of the Vedic sage Kashyapa who is believed to have settled people in this land. Accordingly, Kashmir would be derived from either kashyapa-mir (Kashyapa\\'s Lake) or kashyapa-meru (Kashyapa\\'s Mountain).\\nThe word has been referenced to in a Hindu scripture mantra worshipping the Hindu goddess Sharada and is mentioned to have resided in the land of kashmira, or which might have been a reference to the Sharada Peeth.\\nThe Ancient Greeks called the region Kasperia, which has been identified with Kaspapyros of Hecataeus of Miletus (apud Stephanus of Byzantium) and Kaspatyros of Herodotus (3.102, 4.44). Kashmir is also believed to be the country meant by Ptolemy\\'s Kaspeiria. The earliest text which directly mentions the name Kashmir is in Ashtadhyayi written by the Sanskrit grammarian Pāṇini during the 5th century BC. Pāṇini called the people of Kashmir Kashmirikas. Some other early references to Kashmir can also be found in Mahabharata in Sabha Parva and in puranas like Matsya Purana, Vayu Purana, Padma Purana and Vishnu Purana and Vishnudharmottara Purana.\\nHuientsang, the Buddhist scholar and Chinese traveller, called Kashmir kia-shi-milo, while some other Chinese accounts referred to Kashmir as ki-pin (or Chipin or Jipin) and ache-pin.\\nCashmeer is an archaic spelling of modern Kashmir, and in some countries it is still spelled this way. Kashmir is called Cachemire in French, Cachemira in Spanish, Caxemira in Portuguese, Caixmir in Catalan, Casmiria in Latin, Cașmir in Romanian, and Cashmir in Occitan.\\nIn the Kashmiri language, Kashmir itself is known as Kasheer.\\n\\n\\n=== Terminology ===\\nThe Government of India and Indian sources refer to the territory under Pakistan control as \"Pakistan-occupied Kashmir\" (\"POK\"). The Government of Pakistan and Pakistani sources refer to the portion of Kashmir administered by India as \"Indian-occupied Kashmir\" (\"IOK\") or \"Indian-held Kashmir\" (IHK); The terms \"Pakistan-administered Kashmir\" and \"India-administered Kashmir\" are often used by neutral sources for the parts of the Kashmir region controlled by each country.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nIn the first half of the first millennium, the Kashmir region became an important centre of Hinduism and later of Buddhism.
